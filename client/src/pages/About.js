  Music streaming platforms like spotify and apple music do not forward all the money paid 
by users to the artists but rather keep a big part for themselves. In our opinion, artists are the true 
creators of this value and should also be the earners of the money paid. Therefore, we implemnted a decentralized P2P music platform which supplies the money directly to the artists.
